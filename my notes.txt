Project assignment:
==================
-> view project page
	-> fix pagination
	
-> set issue status
	-> before set, check that new status is possible

-> User Dashboard
	-> order issue by due date in descending order
	-> view and projects that you are associated with (you have an assigned issue in them)

-> Edit Project Page
	-> If the user is the project leader, he can access this page and edit the project

-> Edit Issue page - Route: #/issues/:id/edit
	-> The page is not visible unless the user is the issue’s project leader or assignee. 
	-> If the user is the assignee, they can change the status using an available status (e.g. Open -> Closed).
	-> If they are the project’s leader they can edit the whole issue (including its assignee).
	
Project Bonuses:
===============

User Screens:
------------
-> Issue page - Route: #/issues/:id
	-> View the issue’s comments.
	-> Additional field for adding comments if you are affiliated with this project (you have an issue assigned in the project or you’re the project’s leader).
	
-> Filtering issues in the Project Page - Route: #/projects/:id
	-> Make it so by default the user is showed only his assigned issues. 
	-> Create a filter to see all issues or specific ones based on different criterias (be creative).
	
Administrator Screens:
---------------------
-> Projects - Route: #/projects
	-> Each project has the ability to be edited and an issue to be added to it.

My advanced features:
